Using pythons cryptography library we implemented Fernet cryptography
The Fernet implementation allows for the ability to encrypt and decrypt by using a simple passphrase through KDA
    This is implemented in argon2_hashing.py
File encryption and decrytion is then done using the created data block from user input passphrase
Encrypted files and decrypted files overrride original file
